<t id="1102">\033YRules:\033X Whoever gets as close to 21 as possible but does not exceed 21 wins. If you go over, you have lost. If your adversary has an higher score than you, you lost. Otherwise you've won. You start with one card - value between 1 and 11 - and can ask for more. Once you've decided to stick, the dealer will continue until he decides to stop. None of you can get more than 5 cards.\n\n\n\n\n</t>
